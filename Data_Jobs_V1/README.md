# Data Jobs Dashboard

## Introduction

This dashboard was built for people exploring the **data job market**, including **job seekers** and professionals considering a **career transition**. Information about data roles is often fragmented across multiple sources, making it difficult to form a clear, **data-driven view** of salaries, demand, and job characteristics.

This report consolidates key insights into an **interactive, multi-page Power BI dashboard** that allows users to **explore trends** and **compare roles efficiently**.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project focuses on understanding and applying **core Power BI functionality** within a complete reporting workflow:

- **Working with prepared datasets:** Using an existing dataset of job postings and understanding its structure for analytical purposes.
- **Standard aggregations and built-in calculations:** Leveraging default Power BI aggregations to analyze metrics such as **job count** and **salary distributions**.
- **Core visualizations:** Using **column, bar, and line charts** to explore job demand and compensation trends.
- **Geospatial analysis:** Map visuals to display the **global distribution** of data-related roles.
- **KPIs and tabular views:** Cards for **headline metrics** and tables for **detailed, sortable breakdowns**.
- **Report layout and visual design:** Structuring a **multi-page dashboard** to balance high-level overview with detailed analysis.
- **Interactive reporting features:**  
  - **Slicers** for filtering by job title  
  - **Buttons and bookmarks** for report navigation  
  - **Drill-through** functionality for role-level analysis
